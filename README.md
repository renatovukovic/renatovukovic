## Hi there 👋

# Renato Vukovic

PhD candidate in Computer Science working on **large language models**, **information extraction**, and
**structured prediction**. My work focuses on building reliable, data-driven ML systems that combine
strong empirical evaluation with real-world deployment constraints.

I am particularly interested in:
- Post-training and evaluation of large language models
- Extracting structured representations from unstructured data
- Robust learning under noise, uncertainty, and distribution shift

## Research

- **Text-to-SQL Task-oriented Dialogue Ontology Construction**  
  *Transactions of the ACL (TACL), 2026*  
  Investigates how LLMs can construct and populate structured databases through agentic
  text-to-SQL interaction.

- **Post-Training Large Language Models via Reinforcement Learning from Self-Feedback**  
  *Under review (ICML 2026)*  
  Proposes a method to automatically generate preference data for reinforcement learning by
  leveraging intrinsic LLM confidence in logical reasoning, improving greedy decoding performance
  and calibration without human annotation.

- **Less is More: Local Intrinsic Dimensions of Contextual Language Models**  
  *NeurIPS 2025*  
  Analyzes internal representations of language models during fine-tuning using topological features,
  showing how intrinsic dimensionality can indicate overfitting, grokking, and training exhaustion.
